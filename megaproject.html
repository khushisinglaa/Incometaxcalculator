However, you can also get a rebate of Rs 2,500 under section 87A if you have a total income of less than Rs 3.5 lacs for FY 2018-19. From FY 2019-20 onwards, the rebate has been increased to Rs 12,500 for an income less than Rs 5 lakh. So, that means an individual earning less than 5 lakh will not be required to pay any income tax from FY 2019-20 onwards. If you have tax saving investments under section 80C of up to Rs 1.5 lakh then you will not have to pay any taxes till Rs 6.5 lakhs</p>
